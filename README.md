# mood-lamp
_Internet of Things First Year Project 2017_

This project is a RGB LED based lamp with a connected thermistor. When it's running, the colour of the LED  corressponds to the room temperature. If the room is **cold** the light will be **blue**, if **warm/room temperature** the light is **yellow**, and anything **above 25 degrees Celcius** is **red**. 

From the Wyliodrin app you can control the 'mood settings'. If you want the lamp to shine based on the mood you're feeling you simply select your mood. The mood chosen will overwrite the temperature light and shine the colour relative to the mood.
